# Basic Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) emulator for Linak desks

The Linak DPG adjustable standing desk controllers are used in consumer products such as the IKEA IDÃ…SEN desk.
This repo contains some basic code to run on an ESP-32 that will emulate enough of the functions of the actual
controller to get the Linak Desk Control app (tested on Android and Windows) to recognize the ESP32 as a valid
desk.
